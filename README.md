# Critical Mass Development Intern Application
Hello world! This is my task for the Fall 2021 Developer Intern application at Critical Mass.

## Work/Project Examples
*My recent work/projects*

### personal-financial-planner
  My final group project from Lighthouse Labs coding bootcamp was [Personal Financial Planner](https://github.com/kukim96/personal-financial-planner). Personal Financial Planner is a
React.js based single page application that allow users to connect their bank account, categorize their transactions and receive meainingful insights about their spending. I was in charge
of the Front-end of the projects. It was my second time working with React.js so it gave me an opportunity to dive deeper into it and learn more about it. The feature that I got most familiar with 
from working on this project was the "state" in React. Since I was in charge of the whole UI of the application, I had to do a lot of reading and practice on the state feature of React.js. I had to
use state properly so that the application renders the correct transaction information and the chart depending on what the user selected. Even though there were a lot of learning process during the
process, I am glad that I decided to take on React.js and learn further from it. React.js allowed me to have an app that is single page with a modern and easy to use UI.

### Interview Scheduler
  [Interview Scheduler](https://github.com/kukim96/scheduler) was a single page application built with React.js that allow users to add, edit, and cancel interview appointments in real time. Interview
Scheduler was the first project React.js project that I have worked on. It was a very first time using React.js and coming from building applications with plain JavaScript, it was an eye opening experience. 
I found that I was able to make the app look good both appearance wise and feature wise with much less code. Interview Scheduler also provided me with the opportunity to work with automated testing Framework like JEST and Cypress. I got to familiarize my self with the automated testing framework. I wrote each of the test myself from reading the documentation and I think this will be a really valuable
skill to use in the future as well. Overall, it was a bit intimidating since I was new to React.js and also JEST, and Cypress. There were a lot of documentational reading and trying to get the app to work. It was a valuable experience at the end. It gave me exposue to new frameworks but also gave me confidence that I have the proper knowledge and the problem solving skills to learn a new language or a framework and use it to build or enhance an application.

### Tweeter
  [Tweeter](https://github.com/kukim96/tweeter) was a simplified single-page Twitter clone built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and AJAX. Tweeter was my first project to use AJAX to communicate to the
server. It was also a first project that incorporated jQuery which allowed the app to update the data without refreshing the page. When the user types in a new tweet, it automatically loads on top of the page without having to refresh the page. I also used HTML and CSS in order to style the page for a clean and visually pleasing user interface. This application was also responsive to size. Depending on the device and the display size, the app automatically adjusts to fit the screen. While building this application, the biggest challenge was learning jQuery and AJAX while also trying to style it and make it responsive. There were times I was frustrated, because I could not get the app to look exactly like how I wanted. But with multiple attempts and trying new things, I was able to figure it out. This project made me realize that software development is not easy, but it also made me realize my passion for it. It was very satisfying to figure something out and the knowledge and problem solving skill I gained from it was something that would stick with me forever.
